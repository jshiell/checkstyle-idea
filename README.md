# CheckStyle-IDEA

&copy; Copyright 2006-2016 CheckStyle-IDEA Contributors

Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea)

A plug-in for JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA 15/2016 which provides real-time feedback against a given [CheckStyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) profile by way of an inspection.

Released under a BSD-style licence - please see the LICENCE file for details.

> OS X users of IDEA 15 please note - CheckStyle 6.2 and above require Java 8. 
> As the default IDEA package for OS X runs on Java 6, please make use of the versions
> with the bundled JDK, e.g.
>
> * [Community Edition (15.0.6)](https://download.jetbrains.com/idea/ideaIC-15.0.6-custom-jdk-bundled.dmg)
> * [Ultimate Edition (15.0.6)](https://download.jetbrains.com/idea/ideaIU-15.0.6-custom-jdk-bundled.dmg)
>
> or, for Brew Cask users,
>
> * brew cask install intellij-idea-ce-bundled-jdk
> * brew cask install intellij-idea-bundled-jdk
>
> All other users please note - we require IDEA to be running on JDK 8. AFAIK this is the default as of IDEA 2016.1.

## Use

Once installed, a new inspection will be available in the group 'CheckStyle'. The 'Inspections' item in the preferences panel will allow you to turn this on and to configure it.

Project exceptions are treated a little oddly. Because CheckStyle demands these
to be on the current classpath errors will appear if these have not as yet been compiled. Further, because we cache the real-time checkers for performance reasons, real-time scans may continue to show the errors after a compilation. A static scan will force a reload of the Checker and should resolve this.


## Configuration

Configuration is available under the *Settings* dialogue. This controls configuration for both the inspection and static scanning.

### Configuration Files

The main configuration option is that of the CheckStyle file. Multiple CheckStyle file may be added, and swapped between by using the checkbox. Files may be added using the 'Add' button.

The *Scan Test Classes* checkbox will enable scanning of Java files under test source roots. If disabled, these files will be ignored.

If a custom file is being used and properties are available for definition then these will accessible using the 'Edit Properties' button.

### Eclipse-CS Variable Support

The following variables will be available if you have not otherwise overridden their values:

* **basedir** - mapped to the location of the current module file, or the project directory as a fallback. 
* **project_loc**, **workspace_loc** - mapped to the project directory.
* **config_loc**, **samedir** - mapped to the directory the rules file is in, or the project directory for remote rules files (e.g. HTTP).

### Third Party Checks 

This tab allows you to specify any third-party checks which your configuration file makes use of. All selected directories/JAR files will be added to CheckStyle's classpath.


## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during the check an exception will be thrown, which IDEA will then catch and display in the standard exceptions dialogue. If you're unsure as to why things are awry this would be your best bet - chances are it's a missing property or classpath pre-requisite.


## Notable Extensions

### [sevntu.checkstyle](http://sevntu-checkstyle.github.io/sevntu.checkstyle/)

*sevntu.checkstyle* offers a number of useful checks written by students of the Sevastopol National Technical University (SevNTU). They're also kind enough to
offer instructions on setting them up with this plugin.

### [Checkstyle Addons](http://checkstyle-addons.thomasjensen.com/)

*Checkstyle Addons* offers additional Checkstyle checks not found in other Checkstyle extensions, and it's easy to [set up in Checkstyle-IDEA](http://checkstyle-addons.thomasjensen.com/run.html#run-intellij).


## Development

Note that the plugin has been entirely developed on OS X - while it should be fine on Linux, I've no idea what result you'd get with Windows. YMMV.

The pre-requisites for the plugin are fairly light - you'll need Git and JDK 1.8.x.

    git clone https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea.git checkstyle-idea
    cd checkstyle-idea

You can then easily build via Gradle:

    ./gradlew clean buildPlugin

To run it in a sandboxed IDEA, run:

    ./gradlew prepareSandbox # only needed once
    ./gradlew runIdea

You can also build (and more importantly work on) the plugin via IDEA. There is a project file supplied, however it is targetted at OS X so some paths may be incorrect. You'll also need to have set up an *IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK* if you haven't before - you can do this in *Project Structure*, under *SDKs*, just as you would for a JVM. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I see a *Cannot Load Project* error stating *Unsupported major.minor version 52.0*.
 
The plugin is compiled using language level 1.8, and hence must be run on Java 8. This is because CheckStyle 6.2 and above require at least JVM 1.7, and because I like lambdas.
 
If you're on OS X, use IDEA with the bundled JVM. Otherwise, please ensure IDEA is running using Java 8 or later. [Jetbrains offer a support document on this subject](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/23455956-Selecting-the-JDK-version-the-IDE-will-run-under).

### I see 'Got an exception - java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to get class information for <Exception Class>. (0:0)'

CheckStyle is unable to retrieve information on exceptions in your project until you have built it. Build your project in IDEA and then rescan.


## Limitations

* If you import Gradle project withs **Create separate module per source set** active in IDEA 2016 or above then the module source paths are truncated. This means relative paths (e.g. suppressions on `src/test/.+`) may not work as expected.
* The plugin will throw exceptions if used with class files targeted at a later version than that of the JDK used by IDEA. Please run IDEA on the latest available JVM, ideally the bundled version from JetBrains where available.
* If you change the configuration options the real-time scan will not be updated until the file is either changed or reopened.
* We do not check if a property definition is required for a given file. Hence you can exit configuration without setting required properties. Given, however, that CheckStyle files can change without the plug-in being aware this is something we'll always have to live with to some degree.
* CheckStyle errors and warnings from the inspection are both shown at a single level, as IDEA will only allow one warning level for an inspection.


## Feedback

Any comments or bug reports are most welcome - please visit

## Acknowledgements

This plug-in owes its existence to both the style-overlords at work mandating compliance with a CheckStyle configuration, and the [Eclipse-CS](http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/)
authors for making me jealous of the real-time scan support available for Eclipse.
