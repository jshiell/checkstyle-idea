# Checkstyle-IDEA plugin configuration

# Supported Checkstyle versions, sorted by required Java level. The sorting by required Java level is useful because
# it allows us to offer only such versions which can actually run in the current IntelliJ instance. The plugin, and
# current versions of IntelliJ, already require Java 8, so the Java 7 distinction is just an example, until Java 9
# is released.

# The "base version" must be one of the versions listed above. The sources are compiled against this version, so it is
# the dependency shown in the IDE and the runtime used when unit tests are run from the IDE or via 'runCsaccessTests'.

# Maps unsupported Checkstyle versions onto their supported alternative versions. If one of the keys in this map is
